I learned so much more in the second quarter of ICT. While the first had the basics, the second had more about designing and layouts. Personally, it was a little complicated at first. But once you understand how classes and the style tag works, it gets much easier. I prefer CSS over HTML due to the more opportunities it gives for designing and aesthetic, but I still like to use HTML for the simple parts. I hope to learn more about layouts and maybe transitions in the following quarters.
